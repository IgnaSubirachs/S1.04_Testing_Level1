# 📚 Java Level 1 Exercises

## 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

This project includes three basic Java exercises focusing on object-oriented programming, exception handling, and unit testing with JUnit.

### Exercises:

- **Exercise 1: Library Book Management**
  Create a Java class that manages a collection of books in a library. The class must support:
    - Adding books
    - Retrieving the list of all books
    - Getting a book title by its position
    - Adding a book at a specific position
    - Removing a book by title

  Unit tests verify:
    - The book list is not null after initialization
    - The list has the expected size after inserting books
    - Books are at the correct positions
    - No duplicate titles exist
    - Book titles can be retrieved by index
    - Adding/removing books affects the list correctly
    - The list remains sorted alphabetically after modifications

- **Exercise 2: DNI Letter Calculator**
  Implement a class `IdCalculator` that calculates the DNI letter given a number.
  Write parameterized unit tests using JUnit to validate the letter calculation for 10 predefined DNI numbers.

- **Exercise 3: Exception Handling**
  Create a method that throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
  Write a test to verify the exception is properly thrown.
